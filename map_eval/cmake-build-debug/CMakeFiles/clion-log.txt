CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:10 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindOpen3D.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "Open3D", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "Open3D" with any
  of the following names:

    Open3DConfig.cmake
    open3d-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "Open3D" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "Open3D_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "Open3D"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
